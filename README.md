|
â”œâ”€â”€ src/

â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Card.astro
|   |
|   â”œâ”€â”€ content/
|   |   |
|   |   â”œâ”€â”€ members/
|   |   |   â””â”€â”€ melih-darcan.mdx
|   |   |
|   |   â””â”€â”€ projects/
|   |       â””â”€â”€ crossbar.mdx
|   |   
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Layout.astro
