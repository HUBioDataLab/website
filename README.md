## Project Structure

Inside of your the website, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
/
├── public/
|   |
│   └── project-images/
|       └── crossbar.png
|
├── src/
|   |
│   ├── components/
│   │   └── Card.astro
|   |
|   ├── content/
|   |   |
|   |   ├── members/
|   |   |   └── melih-darcan.mdx
|   |   |
|   |   └── projects/
|   |       └── crossbar.mdx
|   |   
│   ├── layouts/
│   │   └── Layout.astro
|   |
│   └── pages/
│       └── index.astro
|
└── package.json
```

Any static assets, like images, should be placed in the `public/` directory.

You will mostly deal with `content/` folder.
